# Tooling

### Visual Studio
Visual Studio Code is a small but powerful source code editor for Windows, macOS, and Linux that runs on your desktop. It features built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js, as well as a diverse ecosystem of extensions for additional languages and runtimes (including C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Go) (such as .NET and Unity).

Microsoft's Visual Studio Code (often known as VS Code) is a free open source text editor. For Windows, Linux, and macOS, VS Code is available. VS Code has several strong features that have made it one of the most popular development environment tools in recent years, despite its low weight.
Features
VS Code is compatible with a broad range of programming languages, including Java, C++, Python, CSS, Go, and Docker file. VS Code also lets you to add on and even create new extensions, such as code linters, debuggers, and support for cloud and web development. In comparison to other text editors, the VS Code user interface allows for a lot of interactivity.


### PyCharm
What is PyCharm, and why should you use it?
PyCharm is a cross-platform program that runs on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. PyCharm is a Python IDE that supports both Python 2 (2.7) and Python 3 (3.5 and higher).
PyCharm comes with a slew of modules, packages, and tools designed to speed up Python programming while also reducing the time and effort necessary to do so.

PyCharm may also be modified to meet specific development needs and personal preferences. It was initially made available to the general public in February of 2010. PyCharm includes the following features in addition to code analysis:

A graphical debugger is a tool that allows you to see what's going
A built-in unit tester
Support for version control systems integration (VCSs)
Anaconda provides data science support.

### Linux

The most well-known and widely used open source operating system is Linux. Linux is an operating system that sits on top of all other software on a computer, accepting requests from other applications and passing those requests to the machine's hardware.
Linux is comparable to other operating systems you may have used in the past, such as Windows, macOS (previously OS X), or iOS in many respects. Linux, like other operating systems, includes a graphical user interface and the same kinds of applications you're used to, such as word processors, picture editors, and video editors.

### Windows

Linux is comparable to other operating systems you may have used in the past, such as Windows, macOS (previously OS X), or iOS in many respects. Linux, like other operating systems, includes a graphical user interface and the same kinds of applications you're used to, such as word processors, picture editors, and video editors.

Windows has several editions.
Microsoft has released numerous versions of Windows since Windows XP. The fundamental operating system is the same in all of these Windows versions, however certain editions include additional functionality for a fee.
Windows Home and Windows Professional are the two most popular versions of Windows for home computers.


### Github


GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that allows developers to store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code, at a high level. To fully grasp what GitHub is, you must first comprehend two interconnected principles:

Git
version control system.

Developers can use version control to keep track of and manage changes to a software project's code. Version control becomes increasingly important as a software project expands. Consider WordPress...

WordPress is a rather large project at this time. It wouldn't be safe or efficient for a core developer to change the "official" source code if they wanted to work on a specific area of the WordPress codebase.

Linus Torvalds invented Git, an open-source version management system, in 2005.

Git is a distributed version control system, which implies that every developer's computer has access to the full codebase and history, allowing for easy branching and merging.

### Gitlab
GitLab is a web-based Git repository that offers open and private repositories for free, as well as issue tracking and wikis. It's a full DevOps platform that allows developers to handle all aspects of a project, from project planning to source code management to monitoring and security. It also enables teams to cooperate and create better software.

GitLab enables teams to shorten product lifecycles and boost productivity, resulting in more value for customers. Users are not required to handle authorizations for each tool in the program. Everyone in the organization gets access to every component if permissions are established once.

## Visual studio code vs PyCharm

**Performance**
PyCharm consumes about 1 GB of RAM on my system even while it is idle, whereas VS Code seldom exceeds 300 MB. Only when I open many projects with dozens of files does VS code use a lot of RAM.

**Extensibility**
PyCharm is part of the JetBrains IDE family, and all of the JetBrains IDEs allow for plugin extension. On the JetBrains website, PyCharm now offers almost 3000 extensions.

VS Code, on the other hand, is intended to be a basic editor that can be expanded into a full IDE with the help of extensions.
VS Code offers extensions for nearly everything, and developers may easily create their own. The VS Code Marketplace has all of these extensions. As a result, VS Code is considerably more expandable than PyCharm.

**User-friendliness**
PyCharm includes a lot of capabilities that most people don't use on a daily basis (advanced code restructuring tools), and finding out where to locate the configuration settings if you've never used it before may be a little difficult.
It's a lot easier to figure out how to configure VS Code. Simply press Ctrl+Shift+P to bring up a command palette where you can search for whatever you want to perform and have it show in the results.

**Price**
PyCharm is about $200 per year. There is a community version of PyCharm that is free to use commercially, but it lacks many of the features that make PyCharm appealing (such as remote debugging, sophisticated Django support, and support for JavaScript and CSS). VS Code, on the other hand, is a free and open-source project (Free and Open-Source Software).



## Windows vs Linux
| Windows      |     Linux             |

So after I did the review for all available tools chose some of them to implement and develop the project 
after I made deep research to choose IDE I was confused between Visual Studio Code and PyCharmbut I found some features and advantages which make the Visual Studio Code winner.
I will list some advantages of Visual Studio Code that make me like it more:

Cross-platform support :

Windows
Linux
Mac
2. Light-weight

3. Robust Architecture

4. Intelli-Sense

5.Freeware: The best benefit of all for all programmers, and much more so for companies, is that it is free.

6. While many users may use it or have used it just for desktop programs, it also provides excellent tool support for Web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JSON.


There is also a live server extension among such extensions. This add-on is based on my current server, Live. Additionally, this plugin allows us to obtain live functionality for dynamic sites. Live Server - This allows us to refresh the active dynamic content functionality on this web extension by making my current server live.


I picked Ubuntu Linux as my operating system for a variety of reasons, the most significant of which is that it is more good for me since it is fluid and versatile. The terminal and file system is another reason. Because most of Linux was designed to operate on servers, I can explore the system entirely through the terminal.

In the end, I should choose tools that provide me some features such as  store, manage, track, and control changes so I chose GitHub for these reasons :

* It makes it easy to contribute to your open source projects
* Documentation
* Showcase your work
* Markdown
* GitHub is a repository
* Track changes in your code across versions
* Integration options

2.3

Black box testing aids in the discovery of functional, usability, and other feature deficiencies. This type of testing provides a snapshot of a software's performance and output. It boosts software quality while slashing time to market. This type of testing reduces the likelihood of software problems at the conclusion of the user's journey.

Agile techniques are being used by many businesses to assist enhance team performance, customer happiness, and project flexibility. Agile techniques enable organizations to adapt more quickly to market changes and complete more projects effectively. Agile training is a great approach to get your company and project team up to speed on the fundamentals of Agile and related implementation techniques. Many myths and misunderstandings concerning Agile operations may be cleared up through Agile training. It can also assist to highlight the differences between the various Agile implementation approaches and reveal the underlying Agile ideas.


So, after reviewing all of the available tools, I decided to use a few of them to implement and develop the project. After conducting extensive research to select an IDE, I was torn between Visual Studio Code and PyCharm, but I discovered some features and advantages that make Visual Studio Code the winner. I'll mention some of the benefits of Visual Studio Code that make me want to use it more:

1. Support for several platforms:
Mac OS X Windows Linux Light-weight
2. Architecture that is strong
3. Intelli-Sense
4. Freeware: The biggest benefit of all is that it is free for all programmers, and much more so for businesses.
5. While many users may only use it for desktop programs, it also has strong tool support for Web technologies including as HTML, CSS, and JSON.

Among the extensions available is a live server extension. This add-on is based on Live, which is my current server. Additionally, we may use this plugin to get live functionality for dynamic web pages. By making my existing server live, we'll be able to update the active dynamic content capability on this web extension.



For a variety of reasons, I chose Ubuntu Linux as my operating system, the most important of which is that it is more suitable for me since it is fluid and adaptable. Another cause is the terminal and file system. Because most of Linux was built to run on servers, I can use the terminal to examine the system completely.


Finally, I should pick technologies that allow me to save, manage, track, and control changes, thus I chose GitHub for the following reasons:

It makes contributing to your open-source projects a breeze.
Documentation
Markdown is a great way to show off your work.
GitHub is a website where you may save your files.
Changes in your code should be tracked between versions.
Options for integration.
