1.1

As we learned before how much identify the domain problem and business-related problem is very important in any major and in specific in computing, so depends on that we can meet the requirements and make the user satisfied without many conflicts between the team and the users.
The major business-related problem is that Jordan lacks a variety of web pages for online meal ordering. As a result, we built a website that unites many types of restaurants into a single website, making the online meal ordering procedure more easier for the customer.


User and system requirements and specifications:


1- A image of links for the website's accessible eateries can be seen on the front page; each culinary type has its own presentation.

2- The website will open the restaurant's page when the user clicks on the restaurant he or she wants.

3- A full menu is available on each restaurant's page.

4- The user may review the items in his or her shopping basket, delete or add to them, and cancel or place the transaction.


5- The user may view the bill information, including the price of each meal.

The risks we'll face while working on the project include:

1- Task division and time management: We had a vision for tomorrow, but there were a lot of chores to complete, so we assigned each of us a task and completed the project effectively.



2- Poor team communication: Each of us wanted to design something that was the polar opposite of the other, and we struggled at first, but in the end, we picked the best and most acceptable option.

3- Learn new skills: Because not everyone has all of the necessary skills to construct an advanced web page, we assisted one another and looked for ideas and solutions in other places, such as Google.
4- Website is unreliable: The website crashed several times while we were working on it, but each time it did, we figured out what went wrong and fixed it.

5-  poor code quality: try as we can to solve this problem by following some standards and the best practices of writing the code.

• Requirements list
1. The system must feature a home page with a slide presentation of all restaurants for each cuisine type.
2. The system must provide a link to the restaurant's ordering website.
3. On the restaurant's page, the system must provide a complete menu.
4. The shopping cart must contain all of the orders, and the user must be able to cancel or place the order.
5. The system must contain a page that shows how many things the user has selected.
6. There must be a page in the system that displays all invoice data.

Database design:
In this project, we didn't use a database but we use a thing that stores the data in the browser which is called Local Storage, so we build the local storage and the function to manage this process instead of the database.
We have a constructor that takes the meal's name and price, puts it to an array, and then saves it to the Local Storage, and that's how we save the data.

Coding and implementation technique

Agile: The Agile software development demonstration was primarily aimed at helping developers create a system that could quickly adapt to changing demands.
Scrum is an example of an Agile system. It may be a system in which individuals can solve difficult adaptive problems while producing products with the highest efficiency and creativity possible. Scrum uses an iterative approach.

Scrum has the following characteristics:
Scrum is a system that is easy to use.
Scrum places a strong emphasis on self-organization.
Scrum is a simple concept to grasp.
The Scrum approach makes it easier for a team to collaborate.

•Testing technique

Black Box Testing is a software testing approach that involves testing the functionality of software applications without knowing the internal code structure, implementation details, or internal pathways. Black Box Testing is a type of software testing that focuses on the input and output of software applications and is based solely on software requirements and specifications. Behavioural testing is another name for it.
